Section3 - Cloud Computing and AWS 
1. AWS Outposts - hardware from AWS that you can deploy from your own data center. 
                - You can run some AWS services or connect with Region to run other AWS services
2. AWS Local Zone - space which you can deploy your application closer to other application.
3. AWS Wavelength Zone - same thing as AWS Local Zone but for 5G mobile device or IoT(Internet of Things)
*Both 2 and 3 lowers latency*

4. AWS Public vs Private services
Public - Directly connected to the Internet
        - have an end-point that you can connect directly from the internet
        - Storage service => S3
        - Database => DynamoDB
        - DNS Service => Route 53
        - Content Delivery Service - CloudFront
Private - Inside VPC => think of this as virtual data center
        - You can make things inside the VPC as private or public service
        - private do not have public IP address but exist within VPC
        - public service can have public IP but you can also make them private 

5. You can connect private and public space through Internet Gateway
