Section 5
AMI (Amazon Machine Image) => image that contains the operating system and any configuration settings
                           => configuration for the instances
AMI is created from EBS Snapshot => point-in-time backup of an instance
You can create the instance and save it in a EBS Snapshot => deploy the same instance later on
===> this is how you create the custom profile or AMI
