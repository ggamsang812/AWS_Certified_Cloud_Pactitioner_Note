Scaling Up => Vertical => straching the instance. => Still have single point of failure
Scaling Out => Horizontal => Auto Scaling Group => Use Load Balancer to spread the load between created instances => elasticity and scalability
Load Balancer - will re-route the connection if the one of the instance fails => High Availability (Fault Tolerance)

Usually use Auto Scaling and Load Balancer together

**Availability Zone are composed of one or more data center**

EC2 Auto Scaling responds to EC2 status checks and CloudWatch metrics
