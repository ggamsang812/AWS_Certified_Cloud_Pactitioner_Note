Section 9 - Networking

VPC - within the region => internet gateway is attached to the VPC to be used to connect to the internet
subnets - within AZs

Virtual Private Gateway + Customer Gateway
=> Amazon VPC side and Customer side of VPN(Virtual Private Network) connection

Security Group (Stateful, Instance level, only allow rule) + Network ACL (Stateless, Subnet level, allow and deny rules)
=> Instance level + Subnet Firewall 

NAT Instance vs NAT Gateway (Both IN public subnet)
=> to connect from private subnets to internet
=> instance in private subnet connects to NAT in public subnet using private IP 
Old way, controlled by me 
vs 
New way,  controlled by AWS manage device, elastic scalable, automatic high availability

VPC Peering - To connect same/different account/region using private IP address
=> NOT transitive => A, B, C needs connection to each other DIRECTLY to each other

Amazon VPN 
=> Public connectivity + variable performance
=> for on-premise data center
=> Virtual Private Gateway on AWS Side

AWS Direct Connect
=> works with AWS Direct Connect Location 
=> Private connectivity between AWS and your data-center => Avoids pulbic internet  
=> consistent network experience - increase speed/latency + bandwidth/throughput 
=> better than VPN for large volumes of data => more cost if not large 

AWS Transit Gateway
=> imagine having VPC Peering for LOTS of VPCs => use this instead
=> is a netwrok transit hub that interconnects VPCs and on-premises networks 
=> can be attached to VPN, Direct Connect Gateway, 3rd parth applications in other region

AWS Outposts
=> Helps with using AWS resources in on-premise data center using specialized hardware from AWS 
=> extend VPC from AWS Cloud to Corporate data center 
=> now you can create private subnets in corporate data center and deploy instance 
=> communicate with private IP address 
=> EC2, EBS, S3, VPC, ECS/EKS, RDS, EMR
