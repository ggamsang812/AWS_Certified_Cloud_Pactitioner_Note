Section 10 - Deployment + Automation
1. Amazon CloudFront 
=> content delivery network (CDN)
=> increase latency by caching 
=> Original content in CloudFront Origins => Gets pushed and cached to Edge Location => Also use AWS Global network

2. AWS Global Accelerator
=> Leverages Edge Location + AWS Global network
=> sending the incoming connections to the regions where your application end points are running
=> Provides failover between Regions => first connects to the closest region from the user and if it that fails it will go to the next region

3. AWS CloudFormation 
=> where we can define how we want to build our infrastructure in AWS in a text file => import this file and deploy our infrastructure globally 

4. AWS Elastic Beanstalk 
=> Platform as a service solution 

5. AWS Development tools 
=> tool sets to deploy a continuous integration and delivery architecture on AWS
