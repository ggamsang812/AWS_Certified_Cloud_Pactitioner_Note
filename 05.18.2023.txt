Section 11 - Databases and Analytics

1. Different types of databases 
=> RDS
=> non-RDS
=> How we use them? 
=> Operational vs Analytic

2. AWS RDS => Runs on EC2 instances => Encryption uses AWS Key Management Service (KMS) => OLTP

3. Amazon Aurora => Database in RDS family 
    => MySQL and PostgreSQL compatible relational database buildt for the cloud => much faster than other SQL 
    => Serverless

4. Amazon RedShift => Data warehouse => easier to analyze data using standard SQL and Business Intelligence(BI) tools => Need EC2 instance

5. Amazon DynamoDB => Key/Value store and document store 
    => Serverless => Non-relational
    => DAX as a caching solution

6. Amazon ElasticCache => Fast temporary storage for small amount of data => In-memory database used for cacheing data 
    => Usually put in front of other data store services for better performance 

7. Amazon Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) => Managed implementation of Hadoop and Spark and it's used for big data analytics and Business Intelligence

8. Amazon Athena and AWS Glue => Analytic services themselves
    Athena queries data in S3 using SQL 
    Uses AWS Glue (Data Catalog) to store information and schemas about the databases and tables 
        => Used for preparing data for analytics
        => Fully managed extract, transform and load (ETL) service
        => Works with data lakes(S3), data warehouse(RedShift), and data store(RDS and EC2 database)

9. Amazon Kinesis => streaming data services
    => Usually constant amount of data


10. Other Databases and analytic services
    AWS Data Pipeline => Process and moves data between different AWS compute and storage services
    Amazon QuickSight => Business Intelligence service => create/publish interactive BI dashboards for Machine Learning-powered insights 
    Amazon Neptune => Managed graph database service (ex. Facebook where you have different relationships in different entities)
    Amazon DocumentDB => Non-relational database service => supports MongoDB, JSON data
    Amazon QLDB => Managed ledger database (the recording of exactly what transactions have taken place)
    Amazon Managed Blockchain => Service for joining public and private networks using Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum
