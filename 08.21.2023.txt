EC2 - Part2 
We need our Ec2 instances to connect to other service

1. Access Key
    => Associated with an IAM User account 
    => Key will pick up whatever the policy is given to user
    => Key credentials will need to be configured and stored on the instance
2. Instance Profile
    => IAM Role is assumed by the EC2 instance
    => No credentials are stored on the instance

3. EC2 Placement Groups => A way that you can control how AWS deploys your EC2 instances and places them within/accross AZ
    => Cluster - low-latency netwrok; tightly-coupled; HPC applications
    => Partition - do not share the underlying hardware; distributed and replicated workloads; Hadoop, Cassandra and Kafka
    => Spread - distinct underlying hardware

4. Network Interfaces 
    => ENI(Elastic Network Interface) - Basic; Can be used with all instance type; within AZ
    => ENA(Elastic Network Adapter) - Enhanced networking performance; higher bandwidth and lower latency; Must choose supported instance type
    => EFA(Elastic Fabric Adapter) - For MPI and ML use cases; tightly coupled applications; can use with all instance types

5. Public, Private and Elastic IP Addresses
    => Public - Dynamic addres; Don't use this in the application bc this will change; Used in Public Subnets
    => Private - Retained; Used in both Public and Private Subnets
    => Elastic - Public IP but it's static; Does not change; You do get charged if not used

6. NAT(Network Address Translation) for Public Addresses
    => Public/Elastic IP doesn't show in the instance; it is associated
    => Internet Gateway performs NAT 

7. Private Subnets 
    => The difference between Public vs Private subnet is really configurations
    => Two things making the subnet Private: 
        1. Not assigning private IP addres to our instances within private subnet
        2. We have route table that does not have Internet Gateway attached to it
        => This will make our instances not communicate with outside world 
    => Public subnet instance having private IP to talk to instance in private subnet
        => This is called Bastion Hosts
