ARN = Amazon Resource Names
An access key ID and secret access key is associated with a user and is used for granting programmatic access using the CLI or API
The account root user credentials are the email address used to create the account and a password.
Delegate permissions => roles. Itâ€™s a great way to provide permissions to resources for users and services without using permanent credentials
Use roles for applications that run on Amazon EC2 instances

Service Control Policies (SCPs) are a feature of AWS Organizations
SCPs contol the maximum available permissions in an AWS account
SCP do not grant permissions
