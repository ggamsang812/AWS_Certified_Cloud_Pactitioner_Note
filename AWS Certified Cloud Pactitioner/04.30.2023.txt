Section 6
DLM (Data Lifecycle Manager)
-automates the creation, retention and deletion of EBS Snapshots and EBS-backed AMIs

EBS vs. Instance Store
1. EBS volumes are attached over the network => persistance 
2. Instance Store volumes are physically attached to host => resulting high performing => data lost when instance powers down

AMIs => provides the information requred to launch an instance
=> with AMIs you can create instance that already has application installed in it
=> no need to go through user data
=> when you create AMI, Sanpshot is created automatically

AMI => backs up entire server including attached EBS volumes
Sanpshot => point-in-time copy of a certain volume

EFS 
=> NFS protocol
=> Used by linux file  system to mount file system over the network
=> You can connect multiple instance from / within AZ and same/different VPC, and on-premises client as well
