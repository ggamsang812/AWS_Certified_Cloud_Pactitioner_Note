Section 8 - Serverless services
SQS - for decoupling / decoupled application 

Serverless services include:
    AWS Lambda => for functions
    AWS Fargate => for ECS container + Docker container
    Amazon EventBridge => Event Bus
    AWS Step functions
    Amazon SQS
    Amazon SNS
    Amazon API Gateway 
    Amazon S3
    Amazon DynamoDB

Amazon MQ - similar to Amazon SQS - Used when customer requireing industry standard APIs and protocols (like on-premise) - Message broker service

Use Step Function rather than Simple Workflow Service => SWF is best suited for human-enabled workflows, like an order fulfillment center or for procedural requests, not event-driven applications

Amazon LightSail - manage the instance you provision
